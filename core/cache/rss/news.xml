&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Servers Are Now Live&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;Welcome to Inferno Phoenix.  Our new 4.0.6a servers are now up and running.  Please check the How To Play section for detail step by step instructions on how to connect.  Please understand that the server does contain bugs so does the website, but with your help in posting the issues to our forum, we will fix the problems as soon as possible.  Also the goblin starting area works some glitches of course but the worgan starting area is completely unplayable at the current moment. We will have this fixed as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</description>
